Summary:

The provided code is a Python script that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for data analysis tasks. 
It offers features such as data loading, filtering, statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning model training. 
The code can be beneficial to various professionals, including real estate analysts and economists.

Practical Application:

One practical application of this code could be in real estate market analysis. 
Real estate analysts can use the GUI to load data sets containing information about properties, such as location, size, amenities, and pricing. 
By applying filters and visualizing data through scatter plots, analysts can identify relationships between variables, explore trends, 
and gain insights into market conditions.

The statistical analysis feature allows real estate analysts to calculate various metrics such as skewness, kurtosis, mean, and median for 
selected columns. This can help in understanding the distribution and characteristics of real estate data. Additionally, 
the GUI provides the ability to train machine learning models like decision trees, linear regression, and random forests. 
Analysts can utilize these models to make predictions about property prices, estimate market demand, or evaluate the impact of various 
factors on property values.

Overall, this code offers a user-friendly interface for real estate analysts to explore, analyze, and visualize real estate data, 
empowering them to make informed decisions and provide valuable insights to stakeholders in the real estate industry.
